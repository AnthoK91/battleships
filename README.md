# js-webpack-prettier-eslint-template

This is a template for new coding project

Simply run `npm run watch`
may also need to run `npm audit fix` if it's been a while.

Components installed:

- webpack, including copy src/img to dist/img
- eslint
- vitest (moved away from jest to avoid config hell - followed this guide https://dev.to/colin-williams-dev/testing-w-vitest-wo-vite-5820)
- prettier

initially there will be an error in the img folder, because there are no images inside. If no images are required for the project, simply delete the folder from src.
